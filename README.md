# Sentence-Level-Summ
 Sentence-Level Extractive Text Summarisation on WikiHow Data    
 This repository stores the relevant files for NTU 2021/2022 Sem 2 AI6127 Deep Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing course group project. Great appreciation for all the other team members' hard work.    
 ### Model Structure
 
![Model structure](https://github.com/zhangziyi1996/Sentence-Level-Summ/assets/143377198/bbfa45e8-52af-4b43-8edf-7436a0203976)      
The overall model structure is shown as above, where the core part is the bottom pre-trained sentence embedding transformer from HuggingFace.     
Specifically, two sentence-level encoders **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** & **all-distilroberta-v1** are used in this project and their empirical performances are compared side by side.    

### Model Details
• Pre-trained Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 / all-distilroberta-v1   
• Input Dimension: 384 / 768   
• Hidden Layer Dimension: 256   
• Number of Encoder Layers: 3   
• Number of Attention Heads: 4   

### Dataset Introduction
In 2018, the WikiHow dataset was completed and hosted as a public dataset as a solution to the lack of publicly-available large-scale quality text summarization datasets. Different from the other commonly used summarization datasets such as New York Times, CNN/Daily Mail and etc., WikiHow contains articles written by mostly ordinary people. This non-professional style prevents 
the ubiquitous Inverted Pyramid writing style in news articles , which leads to an abnormally high score of the naive lead-3 summarization method. The dataset was constructed by extracting articles from WikiHow website and in total comprises of 230,843 articles and respective summary pairs.
### Evaluation Results
Other than the proposed model, other comparison baselines used are:   
• TextRank [1]    
• MatchSum model proposed in the paper: "Extractive Summarization as Text Matching" [2]      
• HiBERT model proposed in the paper: "HIBERT: Document Level Pre-training of Hierarchical Bidirectional Transformers for
Document Summarization" [3]     
The final evaluation result is shown in the table below: (PTX-Sum is our proposed model name)

As what can be seen in the table, our proposed model which uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 as sentence-level encoder achieves the best result.
